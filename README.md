Machine Learning Repository where I post my work which I have done while learning the course

### Pre-requisites
> - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
> - [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)
> - [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate#installation)
> - [To Install Turi Create on Windows](https://blog.usejournal.com/installing-turicreate-on-windows-10-534e147a4792)
>   - Turi Create doesn't support Windows so can't directly use it on Windows


#### If any Methode didn't work For Installing Turi Create
> Someone created a Turicreate folder that has notebook files, data folders and csv files. So, you don't need to install Turicreate on your own computer. You can copy that folder in your Google Drive and use it in Google Colab. There is no installation problem and easy to use it to do exercises. You can copy the folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Facb-igSHGcDi6UI1XsWgvYIcnYr5t1k?usp=sharing).
> Follow the steps given in PDF (Available in that link)
